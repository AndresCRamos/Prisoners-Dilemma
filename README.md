A simple web page that lets you test different strategies against each other on a repeated Prisoners's Dilema game

## Implemented strategies

- Always Cooperate: Always cooperates, no matter what
- Always Defect: Always defects, no matter what
- Davis: Cooperates the first 10 moves, then plays as Friedman
- Friedman: Cooperates until the opponent defects once, then always defects
- Joss: Similar to Tit 4 Tat, but it has a 90% chance of betrayal when the opponent cooperated on the last move
- Random: Cooperates or defects randomly
- Tit 4 Tat: Imitates the movement the other strategy did in the last move
